# Anxiary-API
General Assembly Portfolio Project 2

### Description
Anxiary is a front-end react app utilizing the air table API to enable users to create a virtual diary for users who feel anxiety in their day-to-day life. The application will allow users to write, update, delete, their writings. The app will enable users to search for previous entries by date* and numerically score how their mood is on the given day which they can then view in a calendar view to track their mood/anxiety levels over time.

*undecided if searchable by date or post number
